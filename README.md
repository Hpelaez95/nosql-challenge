# nosql-challenge
Added my pymongo sql data to the notebooks. The notebook flows through and queries the UK food database looking for specific queries.
The initial setup has an import of the json file with a mongoimport that converts the json into a mongo database that then has a collection of documents that are queried. 
The data is then verified, followed by an insert of data and an update and then queries that pull aggregated data into pandas dataframes.
